One Button Fruit Ninja

Gathering inspiration from ABAGames' (Kenta Cho's) one button games using CrispGameLib I created the one button Fruit ninja. I wanted to create a game that utilizes timing and "rhythm" as the core mechanic in the game. I also wanted the single input to have multiple actions in the game, so every third perfectly timed button press (middle bar) will send out a laser beam to cut up the fruits. 
Fruit ninja game located in docs/FruitNinja. Used typdef for custom object types in JavaScript. Implemented timings to randomly spawn the apples and increase the dead zone of the timing bar to increase overall difficulty. I also increased the speed of the scroller at the top bar.
